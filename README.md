# touchcursor-mac
Port of the touchcursor-linux project to macOS.

# WARNING
This application is most definitely not working! It was simply duplicated from touchcursor-linux (which is working). I need to research how to convert binding.c to macOS.

# [touchcursor-linux](https://github.com/donniebreve/touchcursor-linux)
This application remaps the `uiophjklnmy` keys to different movement keys when the spacebar is pressed down, allowing you to keep your hands on the home row.

```
i - up
j - left
k - down
l - right
u - home
o - end
p - backspace
h - page up
n - page down
m - del
y - insert
```
