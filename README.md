# WARNING
This application is most definitely not working! It was simply duplicated from touchcursor-linux (which is working). I need to research how to convert binding.c to macOS.

# Thanks to
[Thomas Bocek](https://github.com/tbocek): check him out and thanks for the starting point.  
[Martin Stone, Touch Cursor](https://github.com/martin-stone/touchcursor): wonderful project for cursor movement when coding.

# What this application does
This application remaps the uiophjklnm keys to different movement keys when the spacebar is pressed down, allowing you to keep your hands on the home row.

```
i - up
j - left
k - down
l - right
u - home
o - end
p - backspace
h - page up
n - page down
m - del
```
